    <h1>From milk to no milk</h1>
    <p class='quote'>"When I was a boy, I used to drink milk all the time. It was the <b>BEST</b>. Then I grew up."<br>
    <span class='align-right'>- Pilsbury Philliams, Sole Proprietor of We Don't Sell Milk</span><br><br>
    </p>
    <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pilsbury Philliams, owner and proprietor of We Don't Sell Milk, has been abstinent from milk for over 45 years.
    At the age of 38 he noticed that the milk sections at grocery stores all across the United States were <em>dominated</em> by milk. Pilsbury decided
    this needed to change, so he started his own company We Don't Sell Milk specifically to combat Big Milk.
    </p>
    <h1>The fight against Big Milk</h1>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, We Don't Sell Milk is fighting to get our products stocked in milk sections in grocery stores
        across the US. We are in contact with big names like Food Lion, Walmart, and Kroger in regards to the issue, however there has been
        an incredible amount of pushback. Most of the responses we've gotten so far are mere defelctions or completely non-sensical
        such as "Our milk section is reserved for milk and milk alternatives" or "We're sorry but we cannot stock applesauce in the milk section.
        It's just not a possibility".
